# üì© How to Install

## üì© Installing on Xbox Series X/S ([Xenia UWP](https://github.com/SirMangler/xenia/releases))

**NOTE: You WILL need an Xbox Series X/S running in [Developer Mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/xbox-apps/devkit-activation). We hope this is clear.**

* **Extract and copy your copy of Guitar Hero II Deluxe 360** to your USB drive.

* Download Guitar Hero II Deluxe 360. Xenia UWP currently does not have guitar support so you need to download the `Series X/S Xenia` versions.
  * Copy the contents of it and paste Guitar Hero II Deluxe 360 to your USB drive.

  ### ‚úÖ ***Guitar Hero II Deluxe 360 is now installed!***

<br/>


## üì© Installing on Xenia (Advanced)

*Follow [**Building (Advanced)**](#-building-advanced) first in order to properly follow this guide.*

* Then, **navigate to `windows_bats`** if you're on Windows or **`user_scripts`** if you're on Linux and **run `build_xenia` to automatically update, build, and run Guitar Hero II Deluxe 360*.**
  * *You need to run this script every time in order to play and update the game. `run_xenia` will run the game only and won't update and build it unless a new update is available, so you can use that if `build_xenia` takes too long.*

* If your controller does not respond, navigate to the `_xenia` folder and **map your controller with x360ce**.
  * When it asks you to create `xinput1_3.dll`, create it and **rename it to `xinput1_4.dll`**.
  * If your controller is mapped and recognized and still doesn't register any inputs, unplug it from your PC and plug it back in while Xenia is still open.

## üé® Custom Highways
Guitar Hero II Deluxe 360 supports the import of custom highways via the use of an all in one bat file.

*Follow [**Building (Advanced)**](#-building-advanced) first in order to properly follow this guide.*

* Copy any `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.bmp` file into `\highways\`, then and run `highways.bat`.
  * These will make them show up in game, resize your images accordingly (including those with arbitrary resolutions), and convert them to the proper format for *Guitar Hero II Deluxe 360* to read.

***You will need to rebuild Guitar Hero II Deluxe 360 in order for these to take effect.***

## üé® Custom Theme Textures

By default, *Guitar Hero II Deluxe 360* contains a variety of custom textures, found in the `Overshell` in-game, as well as a way to import your own with relative ease.

### Importing Your Own Textures

*Follow [**Building (Advanced)**](#-building-advanced) first in order to properly follow this guide.*

* Copy any `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.bmp` file into `\custom_track_textures\`, then and run `textures-custom_track_textures.bat`.
  * These will make them show up in game, resize your images accordingly (including those with arbitrary resolutions), and convert them to the proper format for *Guitar Hero II Deluxe 360* to read.

***You will need to rebuild Guitar Hero II Deluxe 360 in order for these to take effect.***

## üìù Setting Custom Default Settings

Custom default settings, such as always setting your preferred track speed, are not saved automatically by Guitar Hero II Deluxe.
You will have to manually edit a file or two and rebuild the game to save your Custom settings.

*Follow [**Building (Advanced)**](#-building-advanced) first in order to properly follow this guide.*

* Navigate to `_init`
    * Open chosen `.dta` file in a text editor

Each `.dta` file handles different things

`init.dta`
> Handles modifers

`init_track_theme.dta`
> Handles color information for the main guitar scene

`init_ui_theme.dta`
> Handles various information about the menus

`init_track_theme_template.dta` and `init_ui_theme_template.dta`
> Backups of the original themes

After you have made your edits run `_init-dta2b.bat` and if needed copy the files from _build/Xbox/gen to /gen on your install.

<br/>

# üî® Building (Advanced)

### Installing Python (Required)
